# RepositoryTesting
Creating my First Repository to Test the Features of GitHub.

1- Added a license, it adds everything automatically.

2- Added my first code to GitHub, HelloWorld.java, for testing.

3- Added an updated version of HelloWorld.java, for testing an update to a file.

4- Tested comments. It adds comments to each contribution one by one. (Created a comment about 'Commit Name Change' for a file.)

5- Checked 'Commit History', changed repository visibility from 'Private' to 'Public'. (Contributions won't be shown to others if the repository that you edit is 'Private'.) (Also GitHub shows used languages for a repository on the side.)

6- Tested 'Creating a Wiki' for the repository, it is smooth and easy to use.
